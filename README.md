#Capstone Project for Codecademy Ready Program

##Colmar Academy

This is my final submission for the Capstone project. I was able to identify
a number of issues in the course of working on the project that unfortunately
would take too much time at this point to correct. These issues are:

-Using adjoining classes
-Using ids when a class would have sufficed
-Defining headings more than once

I didn't figure out how to use a linter until late in the process, but at
least I know how to use one going forward.

I look forward to your feedback. Thanks!
